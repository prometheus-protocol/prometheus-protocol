## Project Summary

Prometheus Protocol provides the three essentials for the open agentic web: a secure **Passport** (identity), a functional **Bank Account** (DeFi), and a trusted **Marketplace** (discovery). We believe the future of the web will be run by AI agents, and in this hackathon, we built the entire foundational layer to make that happen.

## The Problem: Agents are Trapped

AI agents are incredibly powerful. They can reason, plan, and execute complex tasks. But right now, they're trapped.

On the open web, an agent is **blind and broke**. It can't prove who it is, it can't trust who it's talking to, and it has no way to pay for services on-chain. This is the single biggest blocker to a true, open agentic economy, leaving the door open for a future of closed, corporate "walled gardens."

---

## The Solution: A Passport, a Bank Account, and a Marketplace

**Prometheus Protocol sets them free.** We give every agent three simple things: a secure **Passport**, an on-chain **Bank Account**, and a trusted **Marketplace**.

- **Our Identity Layer is the Passport**, letting agents prove who they are.
- **Our Payments Layer is the Bank Account**, for frictionless, on-chain transactions.
- **Our App Store is the trusted marketplace** where they can find and use audited services.

It‚Äôs the complete trust stack for AI agents to finally interact with the world.

## The Proof: We Didn't Just Design This. We Built It. All of It.

That's a big vision. But we're a team that executes. We didn't just build a feature. We built and shipped a live, end-to-end ecosystem from scratch during this hackathon.

#### 1. We Built the Passport (The Identity Layer)

We forged the identity layer for the entire ecosystem: a production-ready, on-chain **OAuth 2.1 provider**, compliant with the latest MCP specification. This is the universal key that unlocks the open agentic web.

#### 2. We Built the App Store (The Marketplace)

We launched the trusted marketplace where agents discover and connect to services. This is a complete, high-trust software supply chain, including:

- A feature-complete, **on-chain App Store** and service registry.
- An **Auditor Hub & Reputation System** where vetted auditors stake USDC to claim audit bounties.
- A full **command-line interface (CLI)** for developers and auditors.

#### 3. We Built the Bank Account (The Agentic Money Layer)

Finally, we built the most critical piece: the financial tools that make an agent's bank account powerful. We didn't stop at an empty marketplace. We built a **complete suite of agent-operable DeFi primitives**, including:

- **Core Wallet Primitives:** Deployed **`Easy Wallet`** and **`Synapse Fund`** for agents to manage allowances, transfer tokens, and operate secure on-chain wallets.
- **Decentralized Exchanges:** Launched **`KongSwap DEX`** and **`Transcendence DEX`** to provide multiple venues for agents to execute token swaps and access market data.
- **Market Intelligence:** Created **`Token Watchlist`** and **`RateStream`** to provide on-chain oracles and registries for agents to discover assets and get real-time price information.
- **Earning & Speculation:** Built **`Final Score`**, a complete on-chain prediction market, allowing agents to deploy capital and generate returns.

## System Architecture

The protocol is a vertically integrated stack where each layer builds upon the last, ensuring a secure and seamless flow from user identity to service execution.
