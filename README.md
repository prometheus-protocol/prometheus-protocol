## Project Summary

Prometheus Protocol is the open-source infrastructure for the decentralized AI economy. We provide the essential on-chain foundation for **verifiable trust, secure identity, and programmable payments** to ensure the future is an open "Web of Agents," not a series of closed "walled gardens." Our full-stack solution includes a verifiable App Store, an on-chain OAuth 2.1 identity provider, and a complete developer toolchain with a CLI and SDKs.

## Problem

The agentic economy faces a critical choice: will it be a series of closed, corporate **"walled gardens,"** or an open, innovative **"web of agents"?**

An open web is impossible without solving the fundamental problem of trust. Without a unified trust layer, the ecosystem defaults to two bad outcomes: a chaotic, unsafe free-for-all, or a lockdown into centralized platforms that stifle competition and extract value.

---

## Solution Overview

**Prometheus Protocol** provides the solution by creating a transparent, on-chain "app store" for the open agentic web, governed by cryptographic proofs and economic incentives. We provide the trust that makes the open economy possible.

## Key Progress & Achievements

We have moved at an accelerated pace to build not just the technical primitives, but the entire economic and social ecosystem required for an open agentic web to thrive.

- **Launched a Complete Economic Engine:**
  - **Usage Mining System:** A full-stack system for developers to reward end-users with USDC for interacting with their services, driving a powerful economic feedback loop.
  - **Public Bounty & Grant Infrastructure:** A live bounty board with over 1,000 USDC in initial bounties to fund the creation of new services, plus a Genesis Grant Program for larger projects.
- **Forged a Robust Trust Layer:**
  - **Auditor Hub & Reputation System:** A dedicated hub where vetted auditors can stake USDC to claim audit bounties from a public queue and build their on-chain reputation.
  - **Automated & Social Integration:** A complete auditor onboarding process with real-time Discord bot notifications for new service submissions.
- **Driven Real-World Adoption:**
  - **Multi-Platform Agent Integration:** Proved end-to-end functionality by creating AI agents that consume Prometheus-verified services using diverse clients, including **n8n, PortalOne, and VSCode.**
  - **Official Documentation & Community:** Launched comprehensive documentation and a new "On-chain AI" tech meetup to accelerate developer onboarding and community growth.

## Economic Model & Sustainability

Our protocol is designed as a self-sustaining economic flywheel for the open agentic web.

1.  **Enabling Monetization (The Foundation):** Our OAuth 2.1 server provides the essential tools for any developer to monetize their AI services with on-chain micropayments.
2.  **Driving Discovery & Trust (The Marketplace):** The App Store is the public marketplace where users and agents discover these monetized services. The Prometheus Certificate acts as a powerful signal of quality and security, reducing friction and encouraging user adoption. **Trust is the lubricant for economic activity.**
3.  **Protocol Sustainability:** The long-term sustainability of the protocol will be ensured by its core utility. In the future, a micro-fee on transactions can be introduced via a transparent, community-vetted process. These funds would flow to a protocol-managed treasury to fund ongoing development, security audits, and ecosystem grants, ensuring Prometheus remains a well-maintained public good.

## Challenges & Learnings

Building a full-stack, on-chain trust layer presented several unique challenges:

1.  **On-Chain OAuth 2.1 Security:** Implementing a secure OAuth server on a public blockchain required leveraging mandatory PKCE, certified responses, and a unique `request_id` system to protect against code interception and malicious boundary nodes.
2.  **ICRC Standard Composability:** Integrating five different ICRC standards into a cohesive system was a significant architectural challenge, requiring careful state management and inter-canister communication patterns.
3.  **CLI Tooling & Build Process:** Creating a professional CLI required solving complex build issues, particularly managing ESM/CJS module compatibility, which we solved using `esbuild`.
