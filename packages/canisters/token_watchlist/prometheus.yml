  why_this_app: An AI agent is only as smart as the context it's given. The Token Watchlist provides that essential context. It creates a direct, on-chain link between a user's actions in the UI and their agent's awareness. By adding a token to your watchlist, you are effectively telling your agent, "Pay attention to this." This is the foundational tool for personalizing and scoping any financial AI agent's behavior.
  key_features:
    - "Seamless Agent Sync: The first tool that directly connects your UI preferences to your agent's operational context."
    - 'On-Chain & Persistent: Your watchlist is stored securely on the IC, available across all your devices, forever.'
    - 'Dual Interface: Provides both a standard backend API for web apps and a standardized MCP tool for agents.'
    - 'User-Controlled: You have full, sovereign control over what your agent sees and focuses on.'
