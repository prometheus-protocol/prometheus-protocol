# OAuth Security Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures implemented to protect OAuth tokens and prevent token theft in the Prometheus Protocol Discord Bot.

## Security Measures Implemented

### 1. Token Encryption at Rest

**Problem**: OAuth tokens were stored in plain text in the database, making them vulnerable if the database is compromised.

**Solution**:

- All OAuth access tokens and refresh tokens are encrypted using AES-256-GCM before storage
- Each token is encrypted with a unique IV (Initialization Vector)
- Authenticated encryption prevents tampering
- Encryption key must be provided via `OAUTH_ENCRYPTION_KEY` environment variable

### 2. Secure Token Logging

**Problem**: Tokens were being logged in debug statements, creating security logs that could expose sensitive tokens.

**Solution**:

- Removed all token logging from debug statements
- Implemented `sanitizeTokenForLogging()` method that shows only first/last 4 characters
- Added audit logging for token operations without exposing token values

### 3. Token Validation

**Problem**: No validation of token format or content before processing.

**Solution**:

- Validate token length (min 10, max 8192 characters)
- Check for suspicious patterns (null bytes, etc.)
- Verify token format before encryption/decryption

### 4. Rate Limiting

**Problem**: No limits on token operations could allow abuse.

**Solution**:

- Implemented rate limiting per user for token operations
- Different limits for different operations (stricter for refresh operations)
- Automatic cleanup of rate limit data

### 5. Replay Attack Protection

**Problem**: Tokens could potentially be reused in replay attacks.

**Solution**:

- Track recent token usage with fingerprints
- Detect and log potential token reuse within 5-second window
- Automatic cleanup of usage tracking data

### 6. Access Control

**Problem**: No validation that users can only access their own tokens.

**Solution**:

- Validate token ownership before retrieval
- Audit log unauthorized access attempts
- Separate requesting user from token owner validation

### 7. Audit Logging

**Problem**: No tracking of token operations for security monitoring.

**Solution**:

- Comprehensive audit logging for all token operations
- User ID partial redaction in logs
- Operation timestamps and metadata tracking
- Separate audit logs from debug logs

### 8. Secure Memory Handling

**Problem**: Sensitive data remains in memory after use.

**Solution**:

- Implemented `secureWipe()` method (best effort in JavaScript)
- Clear sensitive data from variables when possible
- Avoid storing tokens in global variables

## Security Configuration

### Required Environment Variables

```bash
# Primary encryption key - CRITICAL for security
OAUTH_ENCRYPTION_KEY=your_secure_64_char_hex_key

# Optional security settings
OAUTH_RATE_LIMIT_TOKEN_OPERATIONS=50
OAUTH_RATE_LIMIT_REFRESH_OPERATIONS=10
OAUTH_TOKEN_EXPIRY_BUFFER_MINUTES=5
OAUTH_ENABLE_AUDIT_LOGGING=true
```

### Generating Encryption Key

```bash
# Generate a secure encryption key
openssl rand -hex 32
```

### Key Rotation

To rotate encryption keys:

1. Generate new key with `openssl rand -hex 32`
2. Update `OAUTH_ENCRYPTION_KEY` environment variable
3. Restart application
4. **Note**: Existing tokens will become invalid and users will need to re-authenticate

## Threat Model

### Threats Mitigated

1. **Database Breach**: Encrypted tokens prevent direct access even if database is compromised
2. **Log File Exposure**: Sanitized logging prevents token exposure in logs
3. **Replay Attacks**: Token reuse detection provides basic replay protection
4. **Unauthorized Access**: Access control prevents users from accessing other users' tokens
5. **Rate Limiting Abuse**: Prevents excessive token operations that could indicate attack

### Remaining Considerations

1. **Key Management**: Encryption key must be securely managed and backed up
2. **Memory Dumps**: JavaScript runtime may keep sensitive data in memory longer than desired
3. **Side-Channel Attacks**: Timing attacks on token validation (partially mitigated by consistent processing)
4. **Network Interception**: Tokens in transit still rely on HTTPS protection

## Best Practices

### For Developers

1. Never log raw token values
2. Use `sanitizeTokenForLogging()` when logging is necessary
3. Always validate tokens before use
4. Check rate limits before token operations
5. Use audit logging for security-relevant operations

### For Operations

1. Regularly rotate encryption keys
2. Monitor audit logs for suspicious activity
3. Set up alerts for repeated failed token operations
4. Ensure secure backup of encryption keys
5. Use strong, unique encryption keys in all environments

### For Users

1. Users should revoke access if they suspect compromise
2. Regular re-authentication is recommended for sensitive operations
3. Monitor for unexpected OAuth authorization requests

## Security Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Monitor

- Failed token decryption attempts
- Rate limit violations
- Unauthorized token access attempts
- Repeated token reuse detections
- Unusual patterns in token operations

### Alert Conditions

- Multiple decryption failures (may indicate key compromise or corruption)
- High rate of unauthorized access attempts
- Patterns suggesting automated token abuse
- Sudden increase in token operations from single user

## Compliance Considerations

- GDPR: Personal data (user IDs) are partially redacted in logs
- SOC2: Comprehensive audit logging supports security monitoring requirements
- OAuth 2.1: Follows security best practices for token handling

## Testing

The security implementation includes:

- Unit tests for encryption/decryption
- Rate limiting tests
- Token validation tests
- Audit logging verification

Run security tests with:

```bash
npm test -- --grep "OAuth Security"
```
